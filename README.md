# Assignment3_LCD_Relay project requiremnts
As part of smart home, we manage house lights. Our most critical scenario is controlling lights in the corridor, very many people passing through the corridor and you don't want everyone to keep toggling the switch to keep people's hygiene. To achieve this goal, you need to have light intensity sensor which will capture light intensity in the corridor. When the light intensity drops below 350, it is dark and hence the light (connected to 30V ) shall light up, otherwise, the light switches off.
You are required to design the circuit, write a program and upload to the hardware and test the system. The system is expected to accomplish two main tasks; the first task will be to display the value captured by the sensor on the LCD screen. The second task will be to control the state of the corridor light. This corridor light will be connected to the power source of 30V and will be controlled by the Arduino board whose output power is 5V in maximum.

As you embark on this project here are the items that you shall require to have the complete and efficient circuit:

- Arduino Board
- Breadboard
- The power source
- The relay
- The light bulb
- The LCD screen
- The photoresistor sensor
- The cables
- The resistors
- The potentiometer
All the above hardware shall be connected to have one complete circuit. Plus the fact that you shall write and upload the right code for that.

Once everything is complete you shall present a short video presenting how the system behaves when the light is changing between different values. 

Interesting tip: Make the delay so short (take less than or equal to 100 milliseconds) to improve on response time.
